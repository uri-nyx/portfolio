I finished my bachelor's degree in Fine Arts at the [*University of Salamanca*](https://usal.es) in the year 2023. Creating and learning how everithing can be made is my passion: to me, Art is just that, whether it be a painting, an OS, or even this portfolio. I've come to love mostly minimal and simple things, and I'm interested in the convergence of [painting and technology](https://ars-chromatica.art), the *low level* side of software, such as implementing *virtual machines*, programming languages and operating systems, and how to use this resources to tell stories.

If you like my work, or even want to start some project with me, don't hesitate to contact me!
