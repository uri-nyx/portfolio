New iteration of the techniques developed in [Ink](/projects/ink/). These are portraits in various flavors of hand made iron gall ink on gray paper. They serve mostly as a means of researching different recipes of ink, with bases such as oil, alcohol, or acid, and modified quantities of ingredients (excess of iron sulfate, copper, gum, dammar...).
