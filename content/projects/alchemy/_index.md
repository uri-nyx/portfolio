These are texts and record of some miscelaneous experiments with traditional ingredients and materials usually associated with painting and alchemy. 

Recipes for ink, lacquer, dyes and mediums that I have found or stumbled upon are collected in these logs, together with some tests with bleach, acid, metals and other chemicals.
